# GitHub Searcher - SPA

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

GitHub Searcher is a single-page app for searching GitHub users.

There are three main pages: the home page, the search page, and the page that displays searched user.

Home page displays my GitHub profile. 

For this app, besides React and JavaScript, I have used the bootstrap-react framework.
